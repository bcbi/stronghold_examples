Clinician:  Resident
   Met with son and patient with [**Name (NI) 302**] interpreter. From history given
   by son, found that pt's mental status has deteriorated acutely over
   last 2-3 weeks--recognized all family members in a large visiting group
   at the end of [**Month (only) 102**], yesterday did not recognize son. [**Name (NI) 317**] lost a
   fair degree of short-term memory over a longer period (at least 6
   months) but had been playing bingo up until less than a month ago, per
   the son.
   Pt remains non-verbal, making moaning sounds, but was able to shake her
   head
 and nod
 to questions. She affirmed that she was in pain
   but shook her head no or made no response to a series of questions
   about where this pain might be. She appeared to be tracking well,
   registering the presence of intern, interpreter and son separately.
   Additionally discussed goals of care in general terms with son; he says
   that when she was more lucid she emphasized comfort as a general goal
   and that he agrees with this.
   Approximately 45 mins was spent in this meeting.
