Clinician:  Attending
   I had a 60 minute meeting with the patient's daughter and son-in-law.
   They expressed the wish that the patient not be told about the
   diagnosis of myeloma. They are concerned that she will not be able to
   handle the information, that she might
give up
, and that it would
   provoke severe anxiety.
   Since the patient's mental status is not completely clear now, this is
   a moot point at the moment. I conveyed to the family that I would share
   their wishes with the team and the nurses. When her mental status
   clears, however, I strongly urged them to be truthful with Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 27**]
   since patient's often discern or become aware of their diagnosis
   despite the best efforts to protect them from the information;
   deception erodes the credibility of the caregivers and the family
   should this happen and often results in great anger within the patient.
   I also spoke with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 28**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29**] by phone. He agrees that the patient
   now meets diagnostic criteria for myeloma, and suspects the
   hypercalcemia is due to this condition. If so, the myeloma will likely
   need to be treated. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29**] will speak with Ms [**Last Name (Titles) 30**]
s daughter by
   telephone tonight.
